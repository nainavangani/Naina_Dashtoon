Style Transfer Notebook :
This is an implementation of the Style Transfer Technique proposed by https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
Overall, this code combines deep learning and optimization techniques to create a stylized image that merges the content of one image with the artistic style of another. The style transfer is achieved by iteratively updating the pixels of an initial image to minimize a combined content and style loss. The result is a visually appealing image that inherits both the content and style characteristics of the input images.
